        <p>This is a simple website that I coded in the context of CART 211. It is an innovative and playful way to display photos from outdoor activities while effectively communicating the context in which they were taken.

    <div class="content">
        <p>By loading .gpx files (easily created using a GPS and readily available online for any luddites out there) and associating them to a Leaflet map, this website is able to create modals for photos and display them on markers at points chosen by the person displaying them. This behaviour gives greater context of the location and setting in which the photos were taken, as compared to a traditional photo displaying website, like Instagram.
